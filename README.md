## My Objective: 
### For this project I chose to do linear regression of life expectancy by country. In this project, I used a life expectancy data set with data from countries from around the world. we use linear regression to predict the age of death world-wide and by country in the years after the dataset. In this experiment, I get the dataset from the website https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy
